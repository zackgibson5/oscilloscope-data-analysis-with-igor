# oscilloscope-data-analysis-with-igor
There is a python code to combine csv files saved from an oscilloscope into one big csv file. The csv file is loaded (general delimited) to Igor by hand. Then I have Igor code to plot, analyze, normalize, align waves, etc. Code specifically built to analyze pulse waveforms.
